# dinobot
Discord Bot for posting the second panel of a random Dinosaur Comic

# what?
Yeah, you know, [Dinosaur Comics](https://www.qwantz.com/)?

# why.
Seemed like a good idea. Anyway, you will need to create a bot ([these are good instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)), add your token to a config.yaml, invite the bot to a server, and have the code running somewhere. I made it into a service on a server, but whatever you want to do. It has some dependencies, but they should all be in pypi (bs4, Pillow, discord).
